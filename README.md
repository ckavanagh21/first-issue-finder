# First Issue Finder
Finds good first issues on GitHub for new people to open source contributions. 

## How to use
Run the Python program named "search good first issues.py." The program will then ask you what languages you're comfortable with. Type the languages that you know, separated by spaces. For example, you could write "C++ Java Python" as valid input. The program will then return several issues labeled as a "good first issue." Enjoy!

## Issues
If you find anything wrong with the code or have an idea for a new feature, open up a new issue in the "issues" tab. I'll try my best to fix it. Anyone else is welcome to fix it as well. 

## Contributions
If you're looking to contribute, please feel free to open a pull request with your idea.
